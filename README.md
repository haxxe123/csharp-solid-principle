<h1 align="center">SOLID</h1>

## Purpose of this repository

This is only a place to store basic code showing SOLID principle.

## Single-Responsibility Principle
A class should have one and only one reason to change, meaning that a class should have only one job.

## Open-Closed Principle
Objects or entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.

## Liskov Substitution Principle
If class A is a subtype of class B, we should be able to replace B with A without disrupting the behavior of our program.

## Interface Segregation Principle
A client should never be forced to implement an interface that it doesn’t use, or clients shouldn’t be forced to depend on methods they do not use.

## Dependency Inversion Principle
The principle of dependency inversion refers to the decoupling of software modules. This way, instead of high-level modules depending on low-level modules, both will depend on abstractions.
